# DiNV_Development_Masters_Thesis
All code and analyses used in my master's thesis: Development of animal, cellular, and molecular resources for the Drosophila innubila Nudivirus system


The [qPCR_analysis](https://github.com/meschedl/DiNV_Development_Masters_Thesis/tree/main/qPCR_analysis) directory holds all data and code analyzing and visualzing the qPCR experiments done for my thesis. 

The [Infection_suvival_curves](https://github.com/meschedl/DiNV_Development_Masters_Thesis/tree/main/Infection_suvival_curves) directory includes the data and code for analyzing and visualizing infection experiments done in _D. innubila_ flies 

The [PCR_analysis](https://github.com/meschedl/DiNV_Development_Masters_Thesis/tree/main/PCR_analysis) directory holds all data and code analyzing the PCR experiments for determining infection status of experimental flies 

The [Comparing_DiNV_in Dinn_vs_Dv1_cells](https://github.com/meschedl/DiNV_Development_Masters_Thesis/tree/main/Comparing_DiNV_in%20Dinn_vs_Dv1_cells) includes the steps taken analyzing the whole genome sequencing data of DiNV from Dinn-1 cells and Dv-1 cells. This includes sequence QC, mapping, SNP calling, and SNP analyses. 

The [analyses_with_no_category](https://github.com/meschedl/DiNV_Development_Masters_Thesis/tree/main/analyses_with_no_category) directory includes a few individual analyses that did not fit into one of the above directories. These are the data and code for generating the fluid concentration graphs, the code for the _D. innubia_ egg production graph, and the crRNA design tool.
